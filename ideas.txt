There are 5 characters to choose from at the beginning. The character you choose becomes your main character.
The other characters are available to add to your party later. 


like maybe equipment gives you an ability from a random skill tree that can be used without assigning a slot
and the level of the ability on the skill tree would be tied to the rarity of the equipment
and if you use the equipment long enough you can learn that ability on the skill tree without having to learn all the nodes before it
(visual idea regarding that: the branches under the node look withered and the branches above the node fill more slowly than normal (assuming the skills below the equipment skill haven't been learned, "unstable foundation" debuff))
