### Audio not playing

When adding a sound, it must be a stereo audio file. To make an audio file stereo in Audacity: add a new track via Tracks > Add new > Mono track. Copy the audio from your initial track over to the new track. Then, on your initial track, click the name of the track to open a dropdown menu and select Make Stereo Track.

^ This is all wrong, directional audio needs to be mono sounds
