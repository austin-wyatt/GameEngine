## Reverse Tree

•	If a UI element is the root of a new UI tree, a reverse tree will only be generated when a child is added
•	Without a reverse tree the UI element will be skipped over for most (if not all) UI interaction checks
•	The reverse tree contains all of the nodes of the UI tree with the root node being the last and the topmost element being the first, hence “reverse” tree.
