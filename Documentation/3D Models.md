## 3D Models

•	Y forward, Z up when creating models.
•	Apply modifiers (important), write normal, include UVs, triangulate faces
•	Don’t make meta objects (whatever those are)
•	To unwrap object for UV: select the object, open the UV Editing open at the top, press “U” and then select unwrap (or smart uv project)
